# Jack Henry DevCon 2026 Hack-A-Thon

Analyze the data. Find the patterns. Expose the threats. You might not have stopped these financial crimes, but you can stop the next one before the bad actors come back into the branch. Do you have what it takes?

## The Scenario

It's a regular week at the Absolutely Regular Financial Institution (ARFI). This FI uses Jack Henry as their core provider and has leveraged Banno as their digital front door.

Out there is a threat, though. A pink fedora wearing threat -- Carmen Sandiego's financial crime focused second cousin twice removed -- CarMeg SanDiego! #camelcaseforthewin

Using social engineering, an acute awareness of regulatory limits and a knack for identifying slow-to-notice clients, CarMeg has injected her way into ARFI's base and has gained access to funds through both branch-type transactions and digital transactions. ARFI's fraud systems have caught some of them, but have they caught them all? CarMeg is suspicious after all!

At the end of the day, this is a regular financial institution. There isn't one bad actor, there's always customers and members doing weird things. Not all fraud is obvious. Some fraud is slow to cultivate, some customers don't notice things until it's too late, some fraud never reaches the member's view at all.

Some examples that ARFI has experienced in the past: account takeover, dormant account suspicious activity, high risk actions in a digital environment, structuring and kiting. The FI does their best, but budget time is tight and spending more even to save more might be difficult to get approved. Their fraud teams have been hard at work to react but are always looking for better ways to respond to suspected fraud, and maybe in the future -- anticipate it and be prescriptive? That's where you come in!

## The Challenge

Identify a fraud channel that this Financial Institution is experiencing. It can be as generic or as specific as you want. Find examples in the datasets that fit your fraud focus, and create a method to improve reactions to it, anticipate it before it happens or both -- if possible! Bonus points given if you find CarMeg SanDiego and identify what kind of fraud she is attempting (or succeeding at!).

## Submission Requirements

Your submission must contain:

1. **A fraud problem statement.** Examples: "How can ARFI interrupt suspected Structuring?" Or "How can ARFI react faster to account takeover?"
2. **The specific examples in the data** you are using to help build your solution. (Unintentional hint: Missing data and a way to store it would also be acceptable).
3. **Your proposed solution.** It can be an active solution (with enhancements hopefully), a proposed solution, a business plan change solution or a recommendation for software.

You may submit the following:

- A text version fully explaining your solution, documenting what tools and processes you took and suggest for ARFI.
- A powerpoint presentation explaining the problem and solution with or without screen shots.
- A quick video presentation (less than 3 minutes) demonstrating your solution live.
- A mix of all 3. Please avoid interpretive dance. Our insurance policy for the venue does not cover this.

## Grading Rubric

Your submission will be graded out of a score of 20 that balances:

1. Identifying the problem
2. Your technical approach
3. Your creativity
4. Feasibleness of implementation

## Data & Resources

**What you have access to:** A data snapshot including core transactions including savings/share/DDA and loans and digital transactions. Consume these data points and bring in any other APIs or data models you feel are relevant.

## FAQ

1. **Can I use XXXX or YYYY or ZZZZ?** We recommend using vowels, but aside from that you are welcome to use any additional tools that are available to you. But remember, implementability is a big part of the rubric. The lower the barrier to entry, the most implementable your solution is.
2. **Can I use AI?** Sure. But you work at or with financial institutions. Remember, this is customer/member data. If you are using AI, would your CISO approve your solution? Or are you using AI to help form your plan?
3. **Where can I get documentation on the data sets?** Jackhenry.Dev is your first place to look. You may also speak to HackaThon Organizers Joel Bland and Meg Bannister and we will do our best to assist you.
4. **Do I need to use any specific technology?** We fully expect everyone will flex their technology prowess, but all this data could easily be sorted and compared using Excel and basic Excel functions. No favoritism to any specific technology will be shown.

## Judging

The winner will be voted on by the Jack Henry DevCon team. All solutions will be made public at the end of the hackathon.

In addition, every team who submits a solution will be given 2 votes to vote for People's Choice.
