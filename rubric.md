Scoring out of 20

Problem Understanding & Fraud Insight (5 Points)

What we’re looking for:
How clear is your Problem Statement? How deeply does the team understand fraud patterns, financial risk, and industry challenges?

Scoring Guide:

    0–1: Surface-level understanding of fraud; vague use case
    2-4: Clear fraud scenario (e.g., account takeover, synthetic identity, transaction fraud) with some domain insight
    5: Strong grasp of fraud typologies, risk signals, regulatory implications, and operational realities

Technical Approach & Data Usage (5 Points)

What we’re looking for:
Is the solution technically sound and appropriate for financial services?

Scoring Guide:

    0–1: Basic logic or rule-based system with limited sophistication
    2-4: Effective use of models, heuristics, or anomaly detection
    5: Advanced implementation (e.g., ML, graph analysis, real-time scoring, behavioral biometrics, explainable AI)

Innovation & Creativity (5 Points)

What we’re looking for:
Does the solution bring something new or meaningfully improve existing fraud detection approaches?

Scoring Guide:

    0–1: Uses existing fraud tools or concepts with little innovation of established processes.
    2-4: Creative combination of tools or novel detection method
    5: Unique approach or new-to-market concepts

 

Feasibility & Scalability (5 Points)

What we’re looking for:
Can this realistically be implemented in a financial institution? How open source is your solution? Does it require paid-for tools and APIs with cost considerations? Does it require specialized technology resources including education and experience?

Scoring Guide:

    0–1: Unrealistic architecture or ignores constraints or has a very high barrier to entry.
    2-4: Levels of plausible implementation but missing operational details or unclear barrier to entry
    5: Low barrier to entry or entirely open source, completely implementable.
